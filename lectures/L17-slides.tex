\begin{changemargin}{1cm}
  Barriers to parallelization:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item value of {\tt total} depends on previous

    \item addition is actually non-associative for floating-point values
      \\ (is this a problem?)
  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{center}
    Recall that ``associative'' means: 
     \[a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c.\]
  \end{center}
    \only<2-> In this case, the program probably isn't sensitive to rounding,
      but you should always consider if an operation is associative.

    \item A general function could have arbitary side effects.
    \item Production compilers tend to avoid parallelizing any loops with
      function calls.
  \end{itemize}
~\\[1em]

  Some built-in functions, like {\tt sin()}, are ``pure'', have no side
  effects, and are safe to parallelize.

  {\bf Note:} this is why functional languages are nice for parallel
  programming: impurity is visible in type signatures.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Dealing with Function Calls in {\tt solarisstudio}}

\begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item For {\tt solarisstudio} you can use the {\tt -xbuiltin} flag to make
      the compiler use its whitelist of ``pure'' functions.
    \item The compiler can then parallelize a loop which uses {\tt sin()}
      (you shouldn't replace built-in functions with your own if you use this
      option).
  \end{itemize}
  \vfill
  Other options which may work:
  
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Crank up the optimization level ({\tt -xO4}).
    \item Explicitly tell the compiler to inline certain functions ({\tt
      -xinline=}, or use the {\tt inline} keyword).

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Summary of Automatic Parallelization}

\begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}  
To help the compiler, we can:
\begin{itemize}
\item use {\tt restrict} (make a {\tt restrict}ed copy); and,
\item make sure that loop bounds are constant (temporary
variables). 
\end{itemize}
~\\
Some compilers automatically create different versions
for the alias-free case and the (parallelized) aliased case.\\[1em]

At runtime, the program runs the aliased case if correct.

  \begin{changemargin}{2.5cm}
    OpenMP = Open Multiprocessing.\\[2em]
    You specify parallelization; compiler implements.\\[1em]
    All major compilers have OpenMP \\
    \qquad (GNU, Solaris,
      Intel, Microsoft).\\[1em]

  Use OpenMP\footnote{More information:
    \url{https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/openMP/}} by specifying
  directives in the source. \\[1em]

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Benefits of OpenMP}

\large
  \begin{changemargin}{2cm}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item uses compiler directives---
      \begin{itemize}
        \item easily compile same codebase for serial or parallel.
      \end{itemize}
    \item separates the parallelization implementation\\
      from the algorithm implementation.
   \end{itemize}~\\[0.5em]

    Directives apply to limited parts of the code, \\
    enabling incremental parallelization of the program.\\
    (Start with the hotspots.)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[containsverbatim]
  \frametitle{How The Example Works}

\large
  \begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}
    \item \verb+#pragma+ will make the compiler parallelize the loop.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item It does not look at loop contents, only loop bounds.
    \item \alert{It is your responsibility to make sure the code is safe.}
  \end{itemize}
  \vfill
  OpenMP will always start parallel threads if you tell it to, dividing
  iterations contiguously among the threads.\\[1em]

  You don't need to declare {\tt restrict}, but it's a good idea.\\
  Need {\tt restrict} for auto-parallelization (non-OpenMP).
  \end{changemargin}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[containsverbatim]
  \frametitle{Basic {\tt pragma} syntax}

  \begin{changemargin}{2cm}
  Let's look at the parts of this \verb+#pragma+.\\[1em]

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \verb+#pragma omp+ indicates an OpenMP directive;
    \vfill
    \item {\tt parallel} indicates the start of a parallel region.
    \vfill
    \item {\tt for} tells OpenMP: run the next {\tt for} loop in parallel.
  \end{itemize}
  ~\\[1em]

  When you run the parallelized program, \\ the runtime library starts
  a number of threads \& \\  assigns a subrange of the range to 
  each of the threads.
  \end{changemargin}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{What OpenMP can Parallelize}

  \begin{changemargin}{1.5cm}
\begin{verbatim}
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) { ... }
\end{verbatim}~\\[1em]

    Can only parallelize loops which satisfy these conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item must be of the form:\\{\tt ~~for (init expr; test expr; increment expr)};
\item loop variable must be integer (signed or unsigned), pointer, or a C++
random access iterator;
\item loop variable must be initialized to one end of the range;
\item loop increment amount must be loop-invariant (constant with respect to the loop body); and
\item test expression must be one of {\tt >}, {\tt >=}, {\tt <}, or {\tt <=}, and the comparison value (bound) must be loop-invariant.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Note:} these restrictions therefore also apply to automatically parallelized
loops.
  \end{changemargin}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[containsverbatim]
  \frametitle{What OpenMP Does}

  \begin{changemargin}{2cm}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Compiler generates code to spawn a \structure{team}
of threads; automatically splits off worker-thread code into a
separate procedure.
    \item Generated code uses {\tt fork-join} parallelism; when the
master thread hits a parallel region, it gives work to the worker
threads, which execute and report back.
    \item Afterwards, the master thread
continues running, while the worker threads wait for more work .
  \end{itemize}

~\\
As we saw, you can specify the number of threads by setting the
\verb+OMP_NUM_THREADS+ environment variable. (You can also adjust by calling 
\verb+omp_set_num_threads()+).

\begin{itemize}
  \item Solaris compiler tells you what it did if you use the flags \verb+-xopenmp -xloopinfo+, or \verb+er_src+.
\end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item {\tt length} could be either shared or private.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item if it was private, then you would have to copy

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Default Variable Scoping Rules: A Summary}

  \begin{changemargin}{1.8cm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Loop variables are private.
  \item Variables defined in parallel code are private.
  \item Variables defined outside the parallel region are shared.
\end{itemize}
~\\

You can disable the default rules \\
by specifying {\tt default(none)} on the {\tt parallel} pragma, \\
or you can give explicit scoping:

\begin{lstlisting}
#pragma omp parallel for private(i) 
                         shared(length, array1, array2)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Reductions}
  \begin{changemargin}{2cm}
Recall that we introduced the concept of a reduction, e.g.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
    total += array[i];
\end{lstlisting}

What is the appropriate scope for {\tt total}? \\
\pause
Well, it should be
\structure{shared}.

\begin{itemize}
 \item We want each thread to be able to write to it. \pause
 \item But, is there a race condition? (of course)
\end{itemize}

Aha! OpenMP can deal with reductions as a special case:


\begin{lstlisting}
#pragma omp parallel for reduction (+:total)
\end{lstlisting}

specifies that the {\tt total} variable is the accumulator for a
reduction over the {\tt +} operator.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
int data=1;
#pragma omp parallel for private(data)
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
    printf ("data=%d\n", data);
\end{lstlisting}


\begin{itemize}
  \item {\tt data} is private, so OpenMP will not copy in initial 1.
  \item To make OpenMP copy the data before the threads start, use
    {\tt firstprivate(data)}.
  \item To publish a variable after the (sequentially) last iteration of the loop, use
    {\tt lastprivate(data)}.

  ~\\
  Consider this code:

  \begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
#include <math.h>
int main() {
    double array[2][10000];
    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Would parallelizing this outer loop benefit us?\\
    What about the inner loop?
  \end{itemize}

  OpenMP supports \emph{collapsing} loops:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Creates a single loop for all the iterations of the two loops.
    \item Outer loop only enables the use of 2 threads.
    \item Collapsed loop lets us use up to 20,000 threads.

    \item In example, earlier iterations are faster than later iterations.\\
          Result: sublinear scaling---wait for all iterations to finish.\\[1em]
    \item Turn on \emph{dynamic schedule} mode\\ by adding
      {\tt schedule(dynamic)} to the pragma:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Breaks the work into chunks;
        \item Distributes the work to each thread in chunks;
        \item Higher overhead;
        \item Default chunk size of 1\\ (can modify, e.g. {\tt schedule(dynamic, n/50)}).

  Other schedule modes exist, e.g. {\tt guided}, {\tt auto} and {\tt runtime}.

        \item Default minimum chunk size = 1 (can modify)

\large
  \begin{changemargin}{1cm}
  So far, we can parallelize (some) {\tt for} loops with OpenMP.\\[1em]

  Less powerful than Pthreads. (Also harder to get wrong.)\\[1em]

  Reflects OpenMP's scientific-computation heritage.\\[1em]

  Today, we need more general parallelism, not just matrices.

  Purely-static mechanism for specifying independent work units which should run in
  parallel.\\[1em]

  Linked list example:

{\small
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
  #include <stdlib.h>

  typedef struct s { struct s* next; } S;

  void setuplist (S* current) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
      current->next = (S*) malloc (sizeof(S));
      current = current->next;
    }
    current->next = NULL;

  (Exactly) 2 linked lists:
{\small
  \begin{lstlisting}
  int main() {
    S var1, var2;
    #pragma omp parallel sections
    {
      #pragma omp section
      { setuplist (&var1); }
      #pragma omp section
      { setuplist (&var2); }
    }
    return 0;
  }
\end{lstlisting}}

  Parallelism structure explicitly visible.\\[1em]
  Finite number of threads.\\[1em]

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Nested Parallelism}
  \begin{changemargin}{2cm}

  Sometimes you don't want to collapse loops.\\[1em]

  Example: (better example in PDF notes!)\\[1em]

{\small
  \begin{lstlisting}
    #pragma omp parallel sections
    {
      #pragma omp section
      { 
          #pragma omp parallel for
          for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) { ... } 
      }
      #pragma omp section
      {
          #pragma omp parallel for
          for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) { ... } 
      }
    }
\end{lstlisting}}

  To enable nested parallelism, call \verb+omp_set_nested(1)+ or
  set \verb+OMP_NESTED+. (Runtime might refuse.)\\[1em]

  Main new feature in OpenMP 3.0.\\[1em]

  \verb+#pragma omp task+:\\ \qquad code splits off and scheduled to run later.\\[1em]

  More flexible than parallel sections: 
  \begin{itemize}
   \item can run as many threads as needed;
   \item tasks do not need to join (like detached threads).
  \end{itemize}
  OpenMP does the task-to-thread mapping---lower overhead.

  \begin{changemargin}{2cm}
    {\tt untied}: lifts restrictions on task-to-thread mapping.\\[1em]

    {\tt single}: only one thread runs the next statement (not $N$ copies).\\[1em]

    {\tt flush} directive: write all values in registers or cache to memory.\\[1em]

    {\tt barrier}: wait for all threads to complete. (OpenMP also has implicit
barriers at ends of parallel sections.)\\[1em]

    OpenMP also supports critical sections (one thread at a time), atomic
 sections, and typical mutex locks (\verb+omp_set_lock+,
 \verb+omp_unset_lock+).
